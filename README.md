## Web Application Development

This repository contains the implementation of a web application feature as part of an assignment. The goal is to utilize the provided template and integrate a comparison feature for selected metrics in two different time periods. Additionally, there is an option to include a date range picker to allow users to customize the time periods for comparison.

### Features Implemented:

1. **Metric Comparison Panel**: Replaces or edits the existing charts panel in the provided template to display the comparison of selected metrics in two time periods.


### Mock Data:

The assignment utilizes mock data provided within the template. However, modifications or additions to the mock data can be made as needed for the assignment.

### Figma Design Reference:

The design prototype for the component to be created/integrated can be found in the provided Figma link. [Figma Design: Figma, Prototype](https://www.figma.com/)

### Tech Stack:

- **React**: Utilized for building the frontend components and managing the UI.
- **@refinedev/core**: Library used for CRUD operations and data management.
- **dayjs**: Dependency for date manipulation and formatting.
- **recharts**: Used for rendering responsive and customizable charts within the application.
- **react-icons**: Provides access to a library of icons for UI elements.
- **react-date-range**: Component utilized for implementing the date range picker functionality.
- **Modal**: Component for displaying modal dialogs in the application.

## Implementation Details:

The assignment has been implemented following best architectural and coding practices. The UI is designed to be bug-free and match the look and feel of the provided design in the Figma link. 

### Components:

1. **Dashboard Component**: This component serves as the main dashboard interface, displaying the comparison panels and other relevant information.

2. **LineChart Component**: Handles the rendering of line charts for the selected metrics. It also includes the functionality for the date range picker and options editing.
